# quantum_rover
This program builds a small simulation of a rover trying to stay on a path. It reads its surroundings with simple sensors, feeds those readings into a trainable quantum circuit, and learns how to steer. After training, the rover drives through the virtual world, showing how well the quantum controller guides it.
